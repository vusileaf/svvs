                  <p>From nursery to secondary school alma mater, I spent almost 13 years at Acharya Shree Vijay Vallabh School. We had amazing teachers who offered guidance, support and immense knowledge. They not only taught the syllabus but also played a big role in helping us inculcate good values and morals. It is incredible how most teachers had a personal connect with every student! Everyone at ASVVS encouraged dreaming big and provided support in every possible form. I got my first glimpse of research during school expeditions to IUCAA and Muktangan Science Exploratory, which fuelled my aspiration of pursing a career in Science. A big chunk of credit goes to the school and teachers for all of our personal and professional success!</p>

                  <p>In every person's life his/her school plays the role of a high class porcelain and the person himself/herself being the ARTIST of the sculpture of life .The teachings of a particular school determine the quality of that porcelain. It is the foundation stone upon which a kid grows into an adult and it forms the basis of his/her self-image. Fortunately for me, Shree Vijay Vallabh School (SVVS) has been a provider of such high class porcelain. What is special about this place is much more important than academics. It is the virtues instilled on students by teachers who genuinely work for a better future.
                    <br>What I really admire is the bonding and courtesy each Vivian has for their juniors or seniors and the reverence for their teachers. Vivans have spread out in the world and yet and whenever I came across any of our alumni, irrespective of his/her batch and our acquaintance, we both taciturnly agree that SVVS is not just a place, but a treasure!
                    <br>I will always cherish this place, as a place I always be indebted towards.

Teachers at SVVS have always taken that extra mile to ensure students not only studied well but also proactively participated in extracurricular activities. SVVS has been the base for our complete development - physical, mental and emotional.

                    <br>Right from class 5th, I was always inclined towards studying science and then pursuing to become an accomplished engineer.
                    <br>SVVS gave me that initial flight by helping me create a solid foundation in the field of Science and Mathematics. It was only because of this solid foundation that I was able to gain that needed momentum during 11th and 12th Science and then embark on becoming a Computer Engineer. All this would not have been possible without the guidance, encouragement of our teachers from SVVS.
                    <br>There are countless memories of SVVS. This space is not enough to list them all. There are so many teachers from SVVS who have been instrumental in shaping my life. Writing a few sentences about every teacher would not be enough to justify my feelings and respect towards them. I bow down to all my teachers and shall forever remain indebted till my last breath.

                  <p>Today when I started to think about our school, several memories started peeping from those nostalgic days.
                    <br>Honestly, I can’t recall much from pre-primary days but certainly have been told that it took me more than 6 months to settle in Nursery and then Principal madam handled my crankiness quite well. A good school is one which handles its pupils well, like SVVS!
                    <br>Thereafter mostly, I have been a decent case in Primary and Secondary School. Primary School was more of innocence. Learning was ample by observation and influence of people around. This shaped my mind. I should thank school for good environment, right people and a healthy culture. During primary days - the gathering practices, A/V class room sessions, PT classes, ‘Prabhat Pheri’ during Diwali, school picnics were worth mentioning. Overall Primary was easy and protected.
                    <br>Academic wise, I was an average student till 4th grade mostly hidden in the crowd but Secondary School had some different plans for me. Don’t know how but scored Rank 1st and 2nd during Terminals and Final exams of class 5th, was happy as well more confident. I participated in several quiz, elocution and other competitions. Used to enjoy the NIE sessions, sports at Arunkumar Vaidya Stadium. School had started sports club at this stadium everyday from 7am.-8:30 am.
                    <br>Secondary school produced some excellent opportunities in form of giving TMV exams for Maths, IQ and languages. In 9th Std. I had chance to be at IUCAA for 8 days programme and got opportunity to work with Dr. Jayant Narlikar, one of the renowned scientists of the country. Being a part of school band, being prefect, representing school at few inter school competitions was fun.
                    <br>I learned principles like ethics, integrity, non- violence, passion, team work here during the early years of academics and these further have strengthened to shape our careers. Shree Vijay Vallabh School has played a important role in building character which eventually reflects on careers.
                    <br>A big thank you to all of you at SVVS!
