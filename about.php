          <h5>To create responsible citizens with scientific outlook, culture and tradition through holistic education.</h5>

We develop thinking skills by inculcating creativity, enquiry and introspection in our students. Bringing out the best in every child, enabling him/her to make the world a better place, by being true to self and world. Our Mission explains the relationship between culture, tradition and education using scientific outlook.

            <p><b>“The legacy of the institution is a great source of inspiration.”</b>
              Our effort is always to equip our children in every way by providing them with a abundance of activities to explore their innate talents and help them build a strong determination and perseverance.
              Dedicated and motivating staff strives hard to create students who are confident and who know how to shoulder great responsibilities obtaining strength from the discipline and moral values that are inculcated here.
              I believe in the quote of Vince Gowmon who says, <b>“You cannot make people learn. You can only provide the right conditions for learning to happen.”</b>
              So we provide the best modern learning environment for the students. Well equipped Computer Lab, Digital Boards in each Classroom, Installation of Water purification Unit and setting up the
              English Language Lab are some of the few unique efforts taken by the school management for the well being of the students. We want our pupils' time in our school to be memorable, build on what they know and help them become lifelong learners!
              I hope this website will provide you with a flavour of the wide and diverse activities and excellent education offered in the school.

            <p>We are a contemporary primary school that is committed to comprehensive education and meeting the necessities of all the children in our care.
              We want our children to learn together and fulfill their potential, laying the foundations for a lifelong journey of discovery and exploration.
              <br>To mould and shape the vulnerable minds of our children to become responsible citizens is indeed an honored responsibility. The young fertile and eager minds of our students provide an excellent ground for our teaching staff to teach independent thinking, team spirit and discipline. Teaching for us goes beyond the academics.
              <br>I believe in the quote of Jasper Fox,Sr.,<b>”Putting your students’ emotional needs first is important because without feeling safe and understood, no instructional strategy will be effective.”</b> So, we provide a safe, secured and caring learning environment.

they are the most important work.”<br>

            <p>The school plays a central role in nurturing and developing the unique talent of every child and enabling them to blossom by discovering the joy of learning.
              <br>It is rightly said that a child learns from his surroundings. Since they absorb everything quickly it is the duty if the teacher/parent to make the child aware about the things happening around in the child’s vicinity. Every child should be exposed to different activities and important aspects to this tender age for a perfect upbringing.
              Acharya Shree Vijay Vallabh school commits to provide a safe and intellectually challenging environment that will empower students to become innovative thinkers, creative problem solvers and inspired learners prepared to thrive in the twenty first century. High standards and expectations for each student in regard to academic performance, co-curricular participation and responsible citizenship are the foundation of the school. It is with pride that the school holds these high standards and asks each of the students to commit to maintaining the extraordinary record of achievement and contribution that has been the legacy of the school.
              Along with the academics, different festival celebrations and co-curricular activities are organized to enhance the knowledge and development of the child with the right amount of play as well as moral education that the school imparts in them.
              <br>The school warmly invites you to explore Acharya Shree Vijay Vallabh Pre- Primary School as it rededicates itself every day to impart the very best education to the young minds.
