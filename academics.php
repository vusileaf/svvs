                <p>Acharya Shree Vijay Vallabh Secondary School prepares the students for S.S.C examination of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education.
                    <br>The School aims at the holistic development of the students including intellectual, physical, moral and social values. A number of Curricular and Co-curricular activities are arranged by the school for achieving this aim.
                    <br>"Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn."
                    <br>-Benjamin Franklin
                    <br>The Curriculum introduced by Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education is based on the above maxim. The system of evaluation of students has been changed from the year 2010-11 by the Maharashtra Government. The CCE (Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation) pattern is introduced which includes the system of evaluation that has to be carried out throughout the year. It is expected now that the students need to be evaluated on all aspects of the personality development.
                    <br>The objective of this system is to ensure that all children have access to quality education and enables them to achieve their full potential. The students should participate now and also in the future, in the social, economic and educational opportunities of our State and Nation. It is further grounded on the conviction that a successful public education system is directly related to a strong, dedicated and supportive family. The parental involvement in the school is essential for the maximum educational achievement of a child.
                    <br>Acharya Shree Vijay Vallabh School is an English medium school. English has been a part of studies since Pre-Primary. English is not just a subject in the curriculum; it is the medium through which children learn all other subjects. A good command over the language will make it easier for the children to study other subjects too. English is a global language used for communication. The main aim of our school is to help children use English with confidence.
                    <br>• The real essence of the education is the all round development of a student.
                    <br>• Creating an environment to question, reason and explore new ideas and to foster academic excellence.
                    <br>• Our ultimate goal is to make our students achieve success to their 100% potential.
                    <br>• In Acharya Shree Vijay Vallabh School we strive to make the students ‘Smart’ with the use of technology based teaching learning through ‘Educomp Smartclass’. This is useful for preparing children for the future.
                    <br>• Learning a foreign language opens a wide range of opportunities in all the fields. Hence Acharya Shree Vijay Vallabh School has introduced German language from 5th Std. The students learn the subject in such a way that it enhances their skills. If learnt along with other streams of education it will be an added advantage. The school students also get an opportunity to participate in various workshops arranged at various places in India and abroad.
                    <br>• Sanskrit known as God’s language and Mother of Languages is also introduced in 5th Std. In this modern age it is known as the source of knowledge for various Sciences.
                    <br>• Competitive exams not only improve the logical thinking and help in brain storming, but also enhance the reasoning ability, problem solving skills and confidence. Over all it helps in the development of a child at a younger stage.
                    <br>• Our school promotes students to appear for various competitive examinations such as Olympiad Exams for English, Maths &amp; Science and Scholarship Exam for std. V &amp; VIII, Homi Bhabha Exam for VI &amp; IX, Hindi Rashtrabhasha Exam, Drawing Graded Exams and FIT Exams in German. These competitive exams help to identify young geniuses.
                    <br>• Acharya Shree Vijay Vallabh School firmly believes that every child can experience success and go on to the highest class as a responsible and confident young adult, who is well prepared to take charge of the future and become productive member of the community.
                    <br>• Because of the hard work and combined efforts of school, parents and teachers, the school achieves 100% SSC result every year.
